## Installation
Check the Wiki (https://github.com/Potato-Development/notepad-sharp/wiki) for more details on installation. Refer to https://git-scm.com/ for the Git docs.
If you know how to, clone the repo and build the code! Feel free to add feature requests, branch/merge code if you have ideas.

1. Download the zip file via the page or this link: https://github.com/Potato-Development/notepad-sharp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2. Extract the files to a new folder.
3. Execute (double click) ```setup.exe```. A (usually blue) warning window will appear, titled Windows protected your PC telling you that Microsoft Defender SmartScreen has stopped the installation. Click the underlined "More info" and then "Run anyway" to start the installation. Click the left button if setup is in Japanese (sorry).
4. Once the setup has ended, open the Start Menu and search for ```notepad#```.
